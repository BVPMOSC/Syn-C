- Hash Tables: at runtime
	a,b,....z * a,b....z -> Item_to_be_replaced->Replacement ;
 
- Queue of parsed words from input file separated by " " or "\n" or "\r"
*/

No replacement for header files in the XML file




Hash Map to be formed
All functions are keys and the header files which contain them are values.
Parse the I/P Program and form a queue containing all the words in the prog.
Next, Access first letter of header files and Access the DOM directly.

An array of includes:
All header files in original prog are pushed into the array.If any element of the array matches a entry in any XML file, then that entry is removed else retained.

Output file to be prepared at the last

ToDo:
1. Edit XML files: remove the replacement attribute from header file's tag and add an attrib called "header" for every function's tag. Header attribute contains the header file of the replacement.
2. Read about Hash Map in C++.


Possible Complications:
1. Difference between prototype of functions
2. Taking into account the amount of "spaces" in the code.
3. Defferentiating words from the program.
