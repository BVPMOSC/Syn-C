- Hash Tables: at runtime

No replacement for header files in the XML file




Hash Map to be formed
All functions are keys and the header files which contain them are values.
Parse the I/P Program and form a queue containing all the words in the prog.
Next, Access first letter of header files and Access the DOM directly.

An array of includes:
All header files in original prog are pushed into the array.If any element of the array matches a entry in any XML file, then that entry is removed else retained.

Output file to be prepared at the last

ToDo:
1. Edit XML files: remove the replacement attribute from header file's tag and add an attrib called "header" for every function's tag.
2. Read about Multi Map in C++.
